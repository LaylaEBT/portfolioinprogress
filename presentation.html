    <p>As a passionate individual with a strong interest in new technologies and IT, I am eager to transition my career towards 
      this dynamic field. I bring a solid background in team management, administration, and customer relations, which has 
      equipped me with valuable skills in organization and versatility. My strategic and results-oriented approach drives me to 
      continuously learn and adapt. I have developed a portfolio showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
      and I am excited to leverage these abilities in a new IT role.
